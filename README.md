Road accidents in all 77 districts of Nepal in 2025, our team developed a machine learning model that could predict the severity of a road crash with 82% accuracy, when analysing over 10. 

We found that motorcycle riders who were speeding made up 68% of the fatal crashes, and that evening hours and the monsoon season turned what should be routine journeys into deadly ones, making them 3-4 times deadlier. The top 10 districts were responsible for 42% of the countries' deadly car wrecks. 

Our recommendations therefore propose that AI-powered speed cameras be set up on the Prithvi and East-West Highways, that mandatory helmets and speed governors be fitted to motorbikes in the 15 high-risk districts and that real-time public dashboards be developed for townspeople and traffic police to monitor accidents.
